            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Junior attending <strong>Wake Early College</strong>,
                Who enjoys learning, researching, and creating.
                I run Track, Indoor Track, and Cross Country 
                for Green Hope High School, and value both 
                physical, educational, and mental success.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite color is orange, and my favorite
                food is chinese takeout. I like learning about
                the world, like music, history, and people, and
                religion. I like watching movies, shows, YouTube,
                instagram reels, and any other form of content. 
                I'm not a <em>huge</em> reader,
                but I try and keep myself updated with whats going
                on in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I come from a soccer family, even though I'm a runner.
                My parents both played soccer in high school, and my older
                brother plays division one in college. On the topic of
                college, I want
                to study computer science, programming, or some other IT 
                Degree. In the future I want to be a software developer. Ever since I
                was a kid I have always liked solving problems. I'm pretty creative,
                and I find creating solutions to complex issues interesting.
